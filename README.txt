~~ v1.1.0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 7/3/2021

This script has been completely rewritten from the ground up!

This python3 script can read basic Verilog and VHDL files and automatically
create testbenches testbench templates for them.

The script has changed entirely. It is now much more organized and readable

As of this version, these are the limitations:
 - The script can only create Verilog testbenches from Verilog source files,
   and the same is true for VHDL.
 - There is no user input at this point, as all filenames and paths have been
   hardcoded.
